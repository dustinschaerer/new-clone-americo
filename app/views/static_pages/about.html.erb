	<h1>About Us</h1>

	<h3>A Tradition of Excellence</h3>
	<p>At Americo, we are proud of our reputation for producing top quality vinyl fabrics at competitive prices. It's a reputation that we've been earning for half a century by serving one satisfied customer at a time.</p>
	<p>As a family owned and operated company, we offer some of the
	most customer friendly policies in the industry. We are happy to say:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>"Yes, we provide custom cuts."</li>
	    <li>"Yes, we have low minimums."</li>
	    <li>"Yes, we can send you all the free swatches you need."</li>
	    <li>"Yes, we have your pattern in stock and ready to ship."</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Quality from Start to Finish</h3>

	<p>Since we own our 78,000-square-foot facility in West Memphis, Arkansas, we control the entire production process, from making our special ink concentrates and adhesives to applying finishes that make our vinyls hold up so well. We buy only the best raw materials from prime domestic suppliers. And every new product is performance tested at an independent lab. So you can be confident that what we advertise, we deliver.</p>

	<p>What makes Americo so successful; however, is our workforce. Most of our employees have been with us for many years. They are among the best trained, most conscientious workers anywhere. You can trust them to stand behind their work and keep their promises.</p>

	<p>Thank you for considering Americo Inc. for your project.</p>
